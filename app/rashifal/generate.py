"""The refresh job: transit brief -> Claude -> checks -> store. One AI call per (rashi, period) page,
returning every configured language at once.

Rules:
- The AI sees only the engine brief; its output is checked for structure, safety (app/ai/safety.py) and
  facts (app/ai/validator.py) in every language. A failed page is regenerated once with the checker's
  feedback. After the last attempt, a language that still has a blocking problem is NOT published; if no
  language is clean the page fails and the stored content for that URL stays exactly as it was.
- Idempotent: a page whose stored content already covers the current window (same window start, all
  configured languages) is skipped unless `force`. A page that is current but lacks a language (it failed its
  checks last time) gets a job for the missing languages only, merged into the stored page - the clean
  languages stay published and are not paid for again. A page is "complete" only with every configured language.
- One failing page never stops the others. `RefreshSummary.ok` is False if any page failed.
- Work runs in rounds (all first attempts, then all retries) so the same code drives plain calls
  (a small thread pool) and the Message Batches API (one batch per round, 50% cheaper). Batching is used for
  rounds of BATCH_MIN_JOBS or more; a single page (`--rashi dhanu --period today`) is called directly.
